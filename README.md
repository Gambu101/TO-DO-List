This is a todo list that helps to align tasks as well as ascertain which tasks have been done.

One can write the tasks they intend to do and it will be placed underneath till it is done. 
Users are advised to click on completed tasks to rule it out as a completed task.
If a task had initally been clcicked as completed, the user can click it again to uncheck it as a completed task
